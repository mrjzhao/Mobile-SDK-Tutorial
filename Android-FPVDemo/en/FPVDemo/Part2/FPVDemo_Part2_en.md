# DJI Mobile Android SDK Tutorial

## How to create a Camera Application: Part 2/2

You can download the final project for this tutorial here: <https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK/Android-FPVDemo-Part2.git>

In Part 1, we implemented the basic FPV view which allowed us to see live video stream from our aircraft's camera. In this tutorial, we use the Inspire 1 as an example to show you how to add photo taking and video recording features to the app. Let's get started!

### 1. Implement the capture function

The **private void captureAction()** function is used to take photos. Whenever the  "Capture" button is pressed, the function will be called to take a photo. Below is the code for this function:
~~~java
	 // function for taking photo
    private void captureAction(){
        
        CameraMode cameraMode = CameraMode.Camera_Capture_Mode;
        // Set the cameraMode as Camera_Capture_Mode. All the available modes can be seen in
        // DJICameraSettingsTypeDef.java
        DJIDrone.getDjiCamera().setCameraMode(cameraMode, new DJIExecuteResultCallback(){

            @Override
            public void onResult(DJIError mErr)
            {
                
                String result = "errorCode =" + mErr.errorCode + "\n"+"errorDescription =" + DJIError.getErrorDescriptionByErrcode(mErr.errorCode);
                if (mErr.errorCode == DJIError.RESULT_OK) {
                    CameraCaptureMode photoMode = CameraCaptureMode.Camera_Single_Capture; 
                    // Set the camera capture mode as Camera_Single_Capture. All the available modes 
                    // can be seen in DJICameraSettingsTypeDef.java
                    
                    DJIDrone.getDjiCamera().startTakePhoto(photoMode, new DJIExecuteResultCallback(){

                        @Override
                        public void onResult(DJIError mErr)
                        {
                            
                            String result = "errorCode =" + mErr.errorCode + "\n"+"errorDescription =" + DJIError.getErrorDescriptionByErrcode(mErr.errorCode);
                            handler.sendMessage(handler.obtainMessage(SHOWTOAST, result));  // display the returned message in the callback               
                        }
                        
                    }); // Execute the startTakePhoto API if successfully setting the camera mode as
                    	// Camera_Capture_Mode 
                } else {
                    handler.sendMessage(handler.obtainMessage(SHOWTOAST, result)); 
                    // Show the error when setting fails
                }
                
            }
            
        });
                   
    }
~~~
There **captureAction()** method consists of two parts - the first sets the camera mode, and the second part sets the camera capture mode and takes a photo. We presents the code for the second step in **onResult()** to make sure the second part runs after the first part is executed successfully.

Build and run the project and try the capture function, if the screen flashes after your press the capture button, it shows that capture feature is functioning. 


### 2. Implement the recording function

Similar to the implementation of the capture function, the **private void recordAction()** function is implemented for recording videos. When a user presses the "Record" button, the function will be called and the app starts recording video. Below is the code for this function:
~~~java
	 // function for starting recording
    private void recordAction(){
        // Set the cameraMode as Camera_Record_Mode.
        CameraMode cameraMode = CameraMode.Camera_Record_Mode;
        DJIDrone.getDjiCamera().setCameraMode(cameraMode, new DJIExecuteResultCallback(){
		 
            @Override
            public void onResult(DJIError mErr)
            {
                
                String result = "errorCode =" + mErr.errorCode + "\n"+"errorDescription =" + DJIError.getErrorDescriptionByErrcode(mErr.errorCode);
                if (mErr.errorCode == DJIError.RESULT_OK) {
                    
                    //Call the startRecord API
                    DJIDrone.getDjiCamera().startRecord(new DJIExecuteResultCallback(){

                        @Override
                        public void onResult(DJIError mErr)
                        {
                            
                            String result = "errorCode =" + mErr.errorCode + "\n"+"errorDescription =" + DJIError.getErrorDescriptionByErrcode(mErr.errorCode);
                            handler.sendMessage(handler.obtainMessage(SHOWTOAST, result));  // display the returned message in the callback               
                            
                        }
                        
                    }); // Execute the startTakePhoto API
                } else {
                    handler.sendMessage(handler.obtainMessage(SHOWTOAST, result));
                }
                
            }
            
        });
        
    }
~~~   
### 3. Implement the stopping recording function

The **private void stopRecord()** function is used to stop recording video. When a user presses the "Stop recording" button, this function will be called and the app stops recording video. Below is the code for this function:
~~~java
	 // function for stopping recording
    private void stopRecord(){
    // Call the API
        DJIDrone.getDjiCamera().stopRecord(new DJIExecuteResultCallback(){

            @Override
            public void onResult(DJIError mErr)
            {
                
                String result = "errorCode =" + mErr.errorCode + "\n"+"errorDescription =" + DJIError.getErrorDescriptionByErrcode(mErr.errorCode);
                handler.sendMessage(handler.obtainMessage(SHOWTOAST, result));

            }
            
        });
    }

~~~

Now, we can build and run the project to verify the functions. You may try out the Record function. If a obtain screenshoot similar to...
![recordVideoScreenShot](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-Tutorial/raw/master/Android-FPVDemo/en/images/recordVideo.png)

Then congratualtions! Your Aerial FPV Android app is complete. You can use this app to control the camera of your Inspire 1.


### 4.Where to Go From Here?

You’ve come a long way in this tutorial: you’ve learned how to use the DJI Mobile SDK to show the FPV view of the aircraft's camera and control the camera of a DJI platform. These are the most basic and common features in a typical drone mobile app: **Capture** and **Record**. However, if you want to create a drone app that is more fancy, you still have a long way to go. More advanced features would include previewing the photo and video in the SD Card, showing the OSD data of the aircraft and so on. Hope you enjoy this tutorial, and stay tuned for our next one!
